@karenevadelrosario2751;That explains a lot about their Product and they've used these adorable Chickens as an example of their car's stability control. I can't believe its been almost a decade since they have made this commercial and it still make us laugh and amazed on their strategic concept. As of now, this is the most brilliant commercial around the world that people always searching for it. Plus, Diana Ross' Song Upside down was a big hit during 1980 and used accurately to this commercial.;7 months ago (edited);58
